These can be chosen from the "Trial Simulation Parameters" area of the interface. Use these parameters to decide the number of treatments in the trial, the characteristics of the burn-in and adaptive phases, and maximum duration (number of treatment periods) of the planned trial. This section is also used to decide how many simulations to run and what objective should be optimized for in the Thompson Sampling algorithm.
The reward model is a linear regression where each treatment is represented by an indicator function. The first treatment is set as the reference. The posterior distribution of these regression coefficients is used to adjust the allocation probabilities for each treatment. Here, you may also decide the within-person noise and choose how much serial correlation to include in the observations. When serial correlation is greater than 0, an AR(1) correlation structure is used.
The user may specify how they might like to construct a Bayesian decision rule for efficacy and futility. A wide range of cutoff values will be assessed in simulations, but the user should specify thresholds that are clinically meaningful to their particular context.
We also provide a simple interface for changing the priors used in the reward model. For simplicity, the interface only allows for Gaussian priors on the regression coefficients. For the noise, a Student's t-distribution prior is used (these are the default in brms). If the user is more familiar with Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, they may also change the parameters used by Stan when createing the posterior sample. Otherwise, we have set the parameters such that the priors are noninformative and that the resulting posterior sample should be reasonably well sampled.
